## Final Design Notes

1. **Color Consistency**: Maintain rich black backgrounds with gold accents across all panels.

2. **Photo Placement**: Position photos strategically to create visual interest and flow.
    - Front cover: Full-body dance pose in complete costume
    - Inside left: Close-up showing facial expressions (abhinaya)
    - Inside right: Action shot capturing dynamic movement
    - Other panels: Smaller supporting images showcasing different aspects of dance

3. **Typography Hierarchy**:
    - Dancer's name: Largest and most prominent
    - Section headings: Second hierarchy level
    - Dance item names: Third hierarchy level
    - Descriptive text: Smallest but still easily readable (11-12pt minimum)

4. **Cultural Elements**:
    - Include traditional motifs such as temple spires, lotus flowers, or traditional kolam patterns
    - Consider incorporating subtle dance mudra illustrations in gold
    - Use authentic Sanskrit/Tamil terminology with English translations where appropriate

5. **Practical Considerations**:
    - Ensure adequate margins (minimum 0.25") to prevent content being cut during trimming
    - Use high contrast (gold/white text on black) for maximum readability
    - Test fold lines to ensure important content doesn't fall on creases

6. **Paper Texture**:
    - Consider a silk or pearl finish for an elegant look that showcases the gold elements
